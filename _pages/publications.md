- SAFE-QAQ: End-to-End Slow-Thinking Audio-Text Fraud Detection via Reinforcement Learning
  
  **Peidong Wang<sup>\*</sup>**, Zhiming Ma<sup>\*</sup>, Xin Dai, YongKang Liu, Shi Feng, Xiaocui Yang, Daling Wang, Wenxing Hu, Zhihao Wang

  **Author ranking:** First Author

  **Contribution:** 
   * Proposed SAFE-QAQ, the first end-to-end fraud detection framework combining slow-thinking reasoning.
   * Introduced an optimization process, reducing reasoning lengths by 48.87\% without performance loss.
   * Developed a real-time detection system enabling 81.4\% faster detection (8.98s vs. 48.31s) while maintaining high accuracy.
  
  Submitted to ACM MM 2025 (under review)

- [TeleAntiFraud-28k: An Audio-Text Slow-Thinking Dataset for Telecom Fraud Detection (Submitted to ACM MM 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24115)
  
  Zhiming Ma<sup>\*</sup>, **Peidong Wang<sup>\*</sup>**, Minhua Huang, Jingpeng Wang, Kai Wu, Xiangzhao Lv, Yachun Pang, Yin Yang, Wenjie Tang, Yuchen Kang

  **Author ranking:** Co-first Author

  **Contribution:** 
   * Proposed TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first multi-task slow-thinking audio-language dataset for telecommunication fraud prevention.
   * Designed a pipeline using real-call ASR, LLM simulation, and multi-agent generation to maximize fraud coverage.
   * Established TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating telecom fraud models with slow-thinking assessments.
  
  Submitted to ACM MM 2025 (under review)

- [Language Models as Continuous Self-Evolving Data Engineers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15151)
  
  **Peidong Wang**, Ming Wang, Zhiming Ma, Xiaocui Yang, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Kaisong Song

  **Author ranking:** First Author

  **Contribution:** 
  * Proposed LANCE, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to autonomously generate, clean, review, and annotate data for training themselves.
  * LANCE automates post-training data construction, improving efficiency, quality, and model performance across tasks by iterative self-training.
  * LANCE enhances mathematical reasoning, improving both basic and advanced tasks with general-purpose data.

  **Author ranking:** Co-first Author

  **Contribution:** 
  * Introduced Agent4SC, a multi-agent framework that creates S{\small TICKER}C{\small ONV}, a multimodal empathetic dialogue dataset.
  * Designed [PEGSðŸ“Œ](https://github.com/ZhangYiqun018/StickerConv), a framework generating empathetic text and sticker responses based on emotional and contextual dynamics.
  * Proposed a method for evaluating multimodal empathetic responses, leveraging LLMs to assess empathy, consistency, and ranking quality.
